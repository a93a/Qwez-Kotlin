# Qwez-Kotlin

Same application as [Qwez](https://github.com/a93a/Qwez) but this time written in Kotlin with more modern stuff:
- Uses same type of architecture: MVVM with a domain/usecase layer for "app logic"
- Coroutines (Instead of RxJava)
- Android Jetpack (Room, Viewbinding (Instead of butterknife), Hilt/Dagger, Material Design, etc)
- Retrofit/OkHttp
- Firebase
- Glide 
- Datastore (Instead of SharedPreferences)
- Timber + LeakCanary + Stetho
